##[0.0.1] - 07.02.2025

## Changed/Features/Notes
- The emergency stop test, door contact test, DC1 and DC2 insulation tests, and charging tests are working well. However, the charging tests are divided into 3 separate tests. It would be useful to create the possibility to perform all tests in a single run.
- There are still some bugs to be fixed. These may originate from issues in the CDS system or an incorrect separation in an earlier process step. This still needs to be investigated further.
- There are many notes that still need to be reviewed.
- Some functions are still missing to further optimize and improve the code.
- Some spelling errors have already been corrected.
- The app is still in a raw state, but it is basically functional.

## [0.0.0] - 10.01.2025

## Changed
- First version of the program to do the necessary charged tests automatically.
- Programming language used: C# .NET Framework 4.7.2
- The program is able to run the necessary cherged test for the EoL process. For this its needed that the program have the next capability:
	- Connect with the CDS.
	- Read the avaiable sinks.
	- Run Test Cases.
	- Manage the CDS's process.
	- Send messages to the user.
- The program is developed to be used in the EoL Laboratory, where the is four test's fields. Each have a CDS with a static IP Address, whych can be changed by user. 
- The program is able to work with 300kW and 400kW Charger.
